# Cusehacks 2022 Workshops
Welcome to the github repository for the cusehacks 2022 workshops

# Planned workshops

## Multicore programming in C
Multicore programming is back again this year! We will be practicing using OpenMP to parallelize C-code. 
This workshop is inspired by Tim Matteson (Intel) and relies heavily on material created by 
him for the expressed purpose of teaching OpenMP

### Content:
The OpenMP data environment
Single Program Multiple Data patterns
Task oriented multicore programming
Alternatives to OpenMP

## Let's Learn A New Programming Language

LLANPL is also back again this year! We will be practicing implementing fundamental C.S. concepts and solving classic problems in a modern programming language. Contact the Innovate Orange team if you have a language preference in advance of the material being published

### Content

LLANPL will develop programs in either Rust or Kotlin to help facilitate hackers learning new languages

Goals for LLANPL

1. Learn the foundations of a new programming language
2. Practice learning new languages using Matt's "On the fly development" strategy
3. Develop a mastermind command line program
4. Work through examples of classic programming problems that are designed to hone your abilities in a new language


# Preparing For Technical Interviews in C++

PTI (ESPN let me have this one please) is an advanced workshop designed to help prepare CS students for technical interviews for software engineering roles

We will tackle problems which require deep thinking and insights to develop algorithms in teams of 2. The workshop folder will contain code samples for you to fill and solve problems, a set of unit tests to verify your code
and a set of solutions and solution descriptions.

Your goal is not necessarily to get all the problems correct during the workshop, but to understand and be able to transfer the skills we try to develop over the hour

The problems we approach are

The N queens problem: Find an assignment on an NxN chess board such that the positions of N queens don't attack one another.
The Cake Bakery Optimization problem: Given a list of cakes, profits, and deadlines the set of cakes which maximize your profit before your bakery shuts down for good
The sumTree problem: Given a sumTree and a set of nodes which have been randomly modified, update the value at each node so the tree is consistent.
Graph search using the Boost library: Given time (on both the developers and workshop leaders parts) we will solve together a graph search problem using the boost graph library (BGL)

# Advika's workshop

Learn about software development from one of Syracuse's brightest students!!

# Machine Learning pt 1: Reinforcement Learning

Learn about reinforcement learning and how you can apply it to problems in your hackathon project. We will implement the Q-learning algorithm and learn about potential methods to improve it.

# Machine Learning pt 2: Neural Nets

Learn about neural nets and how they work. Learn about the feed-forward and back propagation algorithms in addition to technologies like GANs and convolutional neural nets. Learn how you can use the Keras machine learning API to build and train your own models. We will also include a discussion on Natural Language Processing and General Purpose GPU programming

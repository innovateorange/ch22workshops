/* Node class
    desc: Every node knows who its two children are and who its parent is
          Every node has a p-val and a p-val-with-below 
          p-val is a random value [0,1) and p-val-below is the sum of p-val with the 
          p-val belows of the two children nodes

          depth is the depth the node is in the tree (0 is the root)
          is-dirty means the node is in the modified vector (see stree::playTree)
